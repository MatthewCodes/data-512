Date: 10/16/2020

## GOAL
### The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:

1. (A) Demographics have a different idea of what agression is (not uniform distribution)
   (B) The same question but for toxicity
   
2. (A) Annotators from high school will label less comments as agressive than annotators with a master's or doctorate.
   (B) The same question but for toxicity
 
   
3. There will be a positive linear correlation between the number of aggressive labeled comments and toxic labeled comments when grouped by age.

4. There is an even distribution of answers from the age and education demographics.

## Analysis
***

### As you can see from the three bar charts below the answer to 1 is that the different demographics have varying ideas of what toxic/aggressive comments are, there is not a uniform distribution across the different ages, education levels, or genders. 

### From the top right graph we can see that I was wrong with my assumption for question 2. High school students labeled more comments as toxic/aggressive than people that had a masters degree or doctorate. Regarding question 3 there is a positive linear correlation but it is not strictly positive. Generally as someone gets older, the amount of comments they perceive as aggressive is linearly correlated with the amount of comments they perceive as toxic.

### To answer question 4, we can see from the charts below we can see that there is a clear bias in the people selected to participate in this annotation process. There is a significant amount of more people that only completed highschool or got their bachelors degree than any other category. In line with this there is a significant amount of more people that are from ages 18-30, or 30-45 than any other age group.
